// Local storage work.

// localStorage
// localStorage is a type of web storage that allows JavaScript sites and apps to store 
// and access data right in the browser with no expiration date. 
// This means the data stored in the browser will persist even after the browser window has been closed.


// localStorage.setItem('key', 'value');
// localStorage.getItem('key');

// ex-

localStorage.setItem('name', 'John');

console.log(localStorage.getItem('name'));
